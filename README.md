# Susu

A webservice for managing informal co-operatives and similar saving schemes run for friends by friends.

## How It Works

Seraphine enters her basic details to register on the webservice as a user.

The user, Seraphine, creates a savings group and becomes its admin. With her admin privileges she sets up a tenure on the group with information such as the date on which the tenure will go live, and the amount of money to be saved weekly by each friend who subscribes to the tenure.

The webservice presents Seraphine with a link (and code) which she can share with her friends, inviting them to watch her tenure.

Seraphine shares this link with her friends, including Gerald.

Gerald follows the link and decides to watch/opt-into the tenure after going through its details.

At the appointed time the tenure goes live (becomes a live tenure). Gerald, along with every other user who had opted into the tenure, becomes a subscriber to the live tenure.

Every week, the set amount of money is charged on each subscriber's credit card. At the end of each month (every fourth week, actually) one subscriber is credited with the sum of contributions from all subscribers to the tenure. This goes on once for each subscriber until everybody subscribed to the tenure has been credited.

The tenure is then resolved, and a new tenure can go live in the same group.
